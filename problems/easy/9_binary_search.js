/*
Binary Search:
  Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target
  integer. The function should use the Binary Search algorithm to determine if
  the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it
  is, otherwise '-1'.

  If you are unfamiliar with Binary Search, we recommend the Conceptual Overview
  section of this question's video explanation before starting to code.

Sample Input:
  array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 35, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73]
  target = 33

Sample Output:
  3
