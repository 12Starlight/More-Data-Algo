/*
Longest Common Subsequence:

Write a function that takes in two strings and returns their longest common
subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a set of characters that are not necessarily 
adjacent in the string, but that are in the same order as they appear in the
string. For instance, the characters ['a', 'c', 'd'] form a subsequence of the
string 'abcd', and so do the characters ['b', 'd']. Note that a single character
in a string and the string itself are both valid subsequences of the string.

You can assume that there will only be on longest common subsequence.


Sample Input:

  str1 = 'zxvvyzw'
  str2 = 'xkykzpw'

Sample Output:

  [
    'x', 'y', 'z', 'w'
  ]
