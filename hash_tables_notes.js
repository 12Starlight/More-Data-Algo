Hash Tables:
  The slightly bad news is that Hash Tables are actually pretty complicated
  under the hood or rather to make them very good and very performant, there is
  a lot of complicated. Fortunately though, for the sake of coding interviews
  we are dealing with the simple stuff. So, let us jump in. 

  So whaat a Hash Table? To put it simply, a Hash Table is a key-value store. It
  is a data structure where you are able to store pairs of keys and values. 
  Where every key maps to a value. To be clear, you can access a value, given a
  key. But, I would not be able to do the opposite.

  Now keys do not have to be just integers like Arrays with indicies. Instead,
  they can be strings, or other data types depending on the language we are 
  coding in. And the beauty of a Hash Table is thata insertion of a key-value
  pair, deletion of a key-value pair, or searching for a value given a key are 
  all operations that run in constant time on average. 

    -> insertion O(1) T
    -> deletion O(1) T
    -> searching O(1) T

  At this point, you might be thinking, well, this weirdly sounds like an Array.
