Graphs:
  A Graph is a collection of nodes that may or may not be connected to one
  another. Remember, in the Linked List section we called elements 'Nodes', for
  Graphs it is the same thing. 

  So, we have a bunch of Nodes that have integer values. So, for example, 1-11.
  Now between these Nodes we have a bunch of arrows, and these arrows represent
  the connections in between these Nodes. And at it's core, that is it. That is
  a Graph. 

  Now we actually give a name to the Nodes and the connections in a Graph. We
  actually call the Nodes 'vertices', so every Node is a 'vertex' in the Graph,
  and we call the connections or these arrows, we call these 'edges'. So, a 
  Graph is really made up of two special things:

    -> vertices (Nodes that might values, for instance integer values)
    -> edges (connections that connect the nodes to one another)
