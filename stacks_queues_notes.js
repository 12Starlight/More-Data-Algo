Stacks & Queues:
  * Stack
    It is a data structure that supports inserting and removing elements 
    following the last in, first out principle. Which is why you may sometimes
    hear people describe stacks as LIFO data structures. 

      L-I-F-O (Last In, First Out)
   
      | ^
      V |
      ==== <- Last item in stack
      ====
      ==== <- Front of stack

    The last element you put into your stack is the first element you are going
    to take out of your stack.  
      

  * Queue
    These are kind of the opposite of stacks. You can imagine the real life
    example of a queue, as a queue or a line of people waiting to buy tickets
    at the movie theater, for instance. And so, if you want to add an element to
    a queue, you can imagine that someone new, would want to get in line to buy
    tickets. Where would they go? The would go to the back of the line. 

      O -> O O O O -> O 

    And the first person who would get out of the line, would be the person who
    first got into the line. They would buy their ticket, and then they would be
    gone. This type of structure follows a different principle, it follows the
    first in, first out principle.

      F-I-F-O (First In, First Out)

    The first person to get into the queue, is the first person that is going to
    get out. Then the second person to get into the queue, is going to be the
    next person to get out, and so on and so forth.
